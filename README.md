# **FC-Barcelona-Project**

FC Barcelona Project is a beginner project where I used HTML and CSS for now to make a static website about my favorite football club. I hope that in the future versions I can add JavaScript to make it more interactive with the user.

## **Versions**

### Version 0.1 (***The First and Original!***)

As today, 06-21-2022, this is the 0.1 version of FC Barcelona Project. Basic implementations are done, like: 

1. An index.html with basic elements  with HTML (h1, ol, img, p, footer...). Also, the division of the screen using div. 

2. In the second div (the red one), I use an Iframe so you can see the content of another HTML file (lastnews.html).

3. CSS styles. Using CSS not only in the index.html but also in the lastnews.html. The propierties of CSS used are some like margin, font-size, display:flex, width, height, type of padding, background, color, ID selector, etc.


In future versions I would like to add to this project:

1. Better styles in the list element.

2. HTML linked to the text in the list to show in another page or in the Iframe somehow (**MAYBE JAVASCRIPT LOL**)

3. More images!

4. Show a excel files that I worked before so the user can see the data of the matches of FC Barcelona, statics os each player.

5. ***AND MORE...!*** (But I need to think about it...)
